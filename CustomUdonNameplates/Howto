2) To define custom nametag additions, edit CustomNameplateManager.cs and follow the instructions at line 16.
3) Make sure the name exactly fits the displayname that was defined in the API. Log in on VRChat.com and open
https://vrchat.com/api/1/users/USER_ID_HERE?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26 to find the exact displayname.
where USERIDHERE is the UserID you can get on the website.
After that, copy the displayname from the displayName property
4) Profit.
5) Feel free to change the Font Size and customize the NameplateEntity object. (Make sure to edit the prefab in /Prefabs/InternalPrefabs)
